      "(T) You've got one of those MCCs on you, you poor thing...",
      "(T) How is no-one else around alarmed by your presence?!",
      "(T) Is there any good left in you, Neki? Was there ever?",
      "(T) Why is one of you just walking freely around here?!",
      "(T) It appears that the scientist's crazy plan worked!",
