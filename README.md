## Neki translation template

This stand-alone mod for Starbound is a template for translating the Neki mod into other languages; it contains ready-to-use patches for all of the text elements that require translation.
It can be installed as-is by placing into the 'mods' folder of the game; the patches will replace all of the text, adding a "(T)" (for "Translate") before every line.

To create a full localization using this template:
- Make sure you are have the [Neki mod](https://github.com/hyperjuni/Neki) installed
- Download this (Code -> Download ZIP) and extract it into Starbound's 'mods' folder
- Translate all of the text that starts with a "(T)" in all of the files of this 'mod' into another language
- Modify the '_metadata' file - edit the 'author', 'name' and 'friendlyName' fields accordingly
- Playtest thoroughly to make sure you haven't missed or mistranslated anything
- Playtest some more, let your friends playtest it too ^-^
- Publish your translation to the Steam Workshop (or anywhere else)
