      "(T) Hey.. whoa!\nWhat are you..?",
      "(T) I haven't seen a new face in some time, let alone one like yours!",
      "(T) Wow, those are really on there, huh? As real as they get!",
      "(T) Oh, I.. didn't mean to be rude, but.. you look like something straight out of a fantasy.",
      "(T) In any case, welcome to this humble little planet!",
      "(T) If you're looking for core fragments you might find a bunch down in this old mine - you should check it out!",
      "(T) Core fragments are good for chemical reactions, so miners back in the day would use them to make bombs.",
      "(T) I guess the miners left long ago though, because the mine is now overrun with creatures.",
      "(T) You should cut down vines when you see them! They're used for bandages and climbing rope - Both useful.",
      "(T) Be careful about falling! It can be safer to build paths down mountains if you need to.",
      "(T) You should have a flashlight on you for when it gets dark. Hungry beasts come out to hunt!",
      "(T) If you're going spelunking underground, bring some wood for torches!",
      "(T) Be careful with wildlife - Even peaceful creatures will attack you if you start a fight...",
      "(T) Extreme weather affects how you can move around. Always keep that in mind!",
      "(T) I'd take the great outdoors over living in a city any day!",
      "(T) The climate here is nicer than most planets. Other planets aren't so pleasant...",
      "(T) If you smash those white supply capsules you can find everywhere, you'll probably get some neat stuff.",
      "(T) If you stumble across some villages out there, make sure not to anger any guards. Just saying...",
      "(T) The length of a day changes depending on the planet. Pretty cool, huh?",
      "(T) I've heard rumours of weird ruins found underground in many planets. I wonder if it's true?",
      "(T) Can you imagine what it must have been like to only be able to live on one planet?",
      "(T) I haven't been to Earth in years! How is it doing these days?"
