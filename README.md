## Neki translation template

This stand-alone mod for Starbound is a template for translating the Neki mod into other languages; it contains ready-to-use patches for all of the text elements that require translation.
It can be installed as-is by placing into the 'mods' folder of the game; the patches will replace all of the text, adding a "(T)" (for "Translate") before every line.

How to use:
- Make sure you are have [Neki](https://github.com/hyperjuni/Neki) installed
- Download (or clone) this repository into Starbound's 'mods' folder
- Translate all of the text starting with a "(T)" in all of the files into your language
- Modify the '_metadata' file: edit 'author', 'name' and 'friendlyName' accordingly
- Playtest thoroughly, make sure you haven't missed or mistranslated anything
- Playtest some more, let your friends playtest it too :)
- Publish your translation onto the Steam Workshop (and/or anywhere else)
